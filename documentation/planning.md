*Purpose: To establish recommendations and guidelines for guidance and planning of focused ultrasound for the purpose of neuromodulation, including acoustic and thermal simulations, calculating exposure and dose parameters, and skull-imaging.*

## short-term goals 
- To complete phase 1 of modelling intercomparison 
- To make recommendations for a thermal index relevant for TUS (in collaboration with the Safety focus group) 

## 1 year goals (09/2022) 
- To move on to the next phases on modelling intercomparison 
- To reach consensus/guidleines for the thermal index
