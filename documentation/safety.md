# safety
*Purpose: To establish recommendations and guidelines for safety of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) neuromodulation in humans, including contraindications and reporting of adverse events. We will start from a safety guideline on testing healthy humans and expand (later) to patient-/disease-specific guidelines. We will also start from single-session testing and expand (later) to multi-session guidelines.*

# short-term goals 
- To report on a review of literature concerning TUS safety 
- To recommend a metric for mechanical and thermal safety (in collaboration with the Reporting and Planning focus groups) 
- To recommend exclusion/inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers and patients (in collaboration with the Clinical focus group) 

# 1 year goals (09/2022) 
- To provide guidelines for mechanical and thermal safety 
- To provide guidelines for exclusion/inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers and patients
