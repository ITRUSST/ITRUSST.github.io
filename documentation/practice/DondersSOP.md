# 1. purpose
This procedure is intended to ensure that non-invasive brain stimulation studies are consistently conducted in accordance with local ethical regulations and international consensus regarding risk and safety.

# 2. scope
This procedure applies to all non-invasive brain stimulation sessions performed at the ‘Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour’ (henceforth Donders), specifically the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (DCCN), Donders Centre for Cognition (DCC), Donders Centre for Neuroscience (DCN), and Donders Centre for Medical Neuroscience (DCMN, specifically Radboudumc Department of Neurology) at the Radboud University and Radboudumc, for studies considered under the ‘Wet medisch-wetenshappelijk onderzoek met mensen’ (WMO) and requiring approval by a competent reviewing authority (‘Medical Research Ethics Committee’, MREC; internationally also referred to as an ‘Institutional Review Board’). The relevant MREC for studies in the scope of this SOP is the ‘Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek regio Arnhem-Nijmegen’ (CMO).

# 3. responsibility
This procedure includes responsibilities for all investigators, lab managers, research assistants and all other designated staff and supervised students who conduct non-invasive brain stimulation studies at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour at the Radboud University and Radboudumc.

# 4. definitions
## 4.1. researchers and staff
*	experimenter: any designated staff or supervised students conducting non-invasive brain stimulation studies.
*	certified experimenter: an experimenter who is trained in lab usage and participant handling and certified by the lab manager. During experimentation the certified experimenter is responsible for equipment and participant safety.
*	responsible principle investigator (PI): the Donders Institute (associate) principle investigator who is the initiator of the study.
*	institute consultant: expert in non-invasive brain stimulation at the Donders Institute. Responsible for coordinating standard practice, training procedures, and researcher expertise. Consults on procedures, implementation, and safety. Coordinates non-invasive brain stimulation research across the institute.
*	Donders Institute safety board: assigned international experts who provide independent assessment of research proposals for non-invasive brain stimulation and pharmacological intervention studies at the Donders Institute. They review and evaluate study proposals for participant safety and study conduct.
*	clinical research coordinator: responsible for quality assurance of research involving human participants at the Donders Institute, according to national and international regulations, in cooperation with relevant partners, including the CMO (MREC) and Donders management.
*	responsible physician: A MREC approved study has a designated responsible physician that can be consulted for study-related medical issues.
*	lab manager: responsible for daily management of the laboratory site and acts as a central contact. Each site has a lab manager responsible for the lab and experimenter certification.
*	certified lab support: Certified experimenter who supports a lab manager and the institute consultant. Available to train other experimenters and to provide first-line support for lab usage and consultation on standard operating procedures (e.g. safety, inclusion).


## 4.2. research organization
*	study: In a study a single scientific or medical research question is investigated. The nature of a study is characterized by the combined effects of all stimulation protocols employed in that study (see section 4.4).
*	session: A session entails a single continuous period of participation in the experiment. A study can consist of multiple sessions, for example repeated experimentation at different days.
*	study protocol: The structure, organization, procedure and regulations of the study as a whole.
*	stimulation protocol: The parameters and configuration of the stimulation itself (not to be confused with the parameters of the overarching study or session). The stimulation protocol forms an important and integral part of the study protocol.

## 4.3. techniques
The non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques used at the Donders are:
*	transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): see section 9.1.1
*	transcranial electric stimulation (TES): see section 9.1.8
*	transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS): see section 9.1.17

## 4.4. expert guidelines
All certified users and those who plan to use NIBS techniques need to be familiar with the expert guidelines on safety and use of the respective techniques, where available. Minimal required reading is listed below for TMS, TES, and TUS:
*	TMS: “Safety and recommendations for TMS use in healthy subjects and patient populations, with updates on training, ethical and regulatory issues: Expert Guidelines” (Rossi et al., 2020). These current guidelines refer back to the previous guidelines for details on stimulation protocols: “Safety, ethical consideration, and applications guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research” (Rossi et al., 2009).
*	TES: “Safety of transcranial direct current stimulation: Evidence based update 2016” by (Bikson et al., 2016). Supported by “A systematic review on the acceptability and tolerability of transcranial direct current stimulation treatment in neuropsychiatry trials” (Aparício et al., 2016). For guidelines on combined use with MRI, please see: “Methodology for tDCS integration with fMRI” (Esmaeilpour et al., 2020). For guidelines on therapeutic use, please see: “Evidence-based guidelines on the therapeutic use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)” (Lefaucheur et al., 2017).
*	TUS: “Ultrasound neuromodulation: A review of results, mechanisms, and safety” (Blackmore et al., 2019); as well as “Safety of transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation: A systematic review of the state of knowledge from both human and animal studies” (Pasquinelli et al., 2019); and “A retrospective qualitative report of symptoms and safety from transcranial focused ultrasound for neuromodulation in humans” (Legon et al., 2020).


## 4.5. risk assessment
In consultation with the MREC, we follow the definitions and classifications of risk specified by the “Guideline Quality Assurance for Research Involving Human Participants” by the Dutch Federation of University Medical Centres (“Richtlijn Kwaliteitsborging Mensgebonden Onderzoek”, Nederlandse Federatie van Universitair Medische Centra, March 2019). This guideline classifies ‘additional risk’, referring to the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the study that exceeds those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests that are not part of the study under consideration.
The NFO guideline recognizes three levels of additional risk: ‘minimal’, ‘moderate’, and ‘high’. The guideline defines ‘minimal risk’ as ‘a small or moderate chance for inconsequential adverse events, and/or a small chance for moderate adverse events’. This risk can exceed that encountered in daily life. For example, a mild transient headache can be classified as an ‘inconsequential adverse event’, while a focal seizure followed by full recovery can be classified as a ‘moderate adverse event’. Research with minimal risk requires minimal monitoring as defined by the NFU guideline.

Based on the guidelines specified in section 4.4, we distinguish two types of non-invasive brain stimulation study protocols:

*	Consensus on minimal additional risk and burden: study protocols that are described as having minimal additional risk and burden by the international expert consensus guidelines (section 4.4.) and are executed according to the standard operating procedures (this document). These protocols have a ‘small or moderate chance for inconsequential adverse events, and/or a small chance for moderate adverse events’, henceforth together referred to as ‘minimal risk’.
*	Specific risk assessment required: study protocols that are not described as having minimal additional risk and burden by expert consensus or deviate significantly from the standard operating procedures (this document). Please note that protocols that are not explicitly considered in the guidelines are not de facto assumed to have a more than minimal risk. Instead, these studies require separate assessment of their associated risk and benefit.

Risk assessment will consider multiple stimulation parameters and their possible interactions. These considerations are described in detail in appendix 9.2 based on published expert consensus. For example, to assess whether the risk of a TMS study protocol is considered minimal, we follow (Rossi et al., 2020) which refers to table 4 of (Rossi et al., 2009), listing guidelines for stimulation frequency, intensity, and number of pulses. Following these guidelines, most conventional low-intensity and/or low-frequency TMS and TES protocols are considered minimal additional risk, while specific risk assessment is required for TUS protocols and when multiple interventions are combined.  An overview of the protocols within the guidelines is included in the relevant sections in appendix 9.2.

## 4.6. stimulation protocols
Stimulation protocols for TMS, TES, and TUS can be categorized by the duration and neurophysiological mechanisms of the effect (online, short-term, long-term). In a single study more than one stimulation protocol can be employed. Importantly, the nature of a study is always classified according to the effects of the study as a whole, not of individual stimulation protocols. For more information refer to appendix A.

*	online: these protocols rely on immediate excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms that have only instantaneous effects (≤1 sec). Examples: single pulse, burst pulse, and paired pulse TMS, short TES (≤1 min), and pulse or burst TUS protocols (≤1 sec).
*	short-term: these protocols rely on transient functional modulations of synaptic efficacy that have short-lasting effects (>1 sec, ≤3 hours). Examples: repetitive TMS (rTMS), theta burst stimulation (iTBS and cTBS), continuous TES (>1 min), and repetitive or patterned TUS (>1 sec).
*	medium-term: these protocols rely on slow but transient modulations of synaptic efficacy that have medium-term effects (>3 hours, ≤1 week). These protocols typically capitalize upon physiological mechanisms of plasticity with tailored parameters or aim to induce cumulative effects by repeating sessions. Examples: paired-associative TMS with 300 pairings, or 6000 TMS pulses per day (high-intensity, 10 Hz, 5 sec on – 10 sec off, for 30 min) delivered on three consecutive days.
*	long-term: these protocols rely on slow structural modulations of synaptic function that have long-lasting effects (>1 week). These stimulation protocols always entail repeated sessions (e.g. daily) over a prolonged period (e.g. weeks) with typically high-quantity, high-intensity and/or high-frequency pulse delivery. Example: 6000 TMS pulses per day (high-intensity, 10 Hz, 5 sec on – 10 sec off, for 30 min), repeatedly applied with up to 70 sessions over 12 months (i.e., 420,000 pulses).
*	other: these protocols do not meet any of the above criteria and/or the effects are not yet well-known. In general, the procedures for long-term stimulation protocols apply, except if all stimulation parameters (including intensity, frequency and quantity) are similar or lower than those of existing online, short-term, or medium-term stimulation protocols, in which case the respective procedures apply.
